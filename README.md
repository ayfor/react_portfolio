# react_portfolio

This is my first draft of a portfolio website that utilizes React fundamentals to create a basic portfolio with the following pages:

1. About Me Section
2. Projects
3. Contact Form
4. Resume

This application can be iterated upon to improve my career development materials and by extension my ability to network.

Here is the [link to the deployed application](https://ayfor.github.io/react_portfolio/#/)
